Synthea can be configured to export data as CSV into `./output/csv`.

To export CSV, edit `./src/main/resources/synthea.properties` and change this setting:

```properties
exporter.csv.export = true
```

Note that you should build again.
```
./gradlew build check test
```

After running Synthea, the CSV exporter will create these files:
