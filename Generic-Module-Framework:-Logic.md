```json
{
  "condition_type": "Race",
  "race": "Hispanic"
}
```

## Symptom

The `Symptom` condition type tests a patient's current symptoms. Synthea tracks symptoms in order to drive a patient's encounters, on a scale of 1-100. A symptom may be tracked for multiple conditions, in these cases only the highest value is considered. See also the [[Symptom|Generic Module Framework: States#symptom]] state.

  "condition_type": "Symptom",
  "symptom" : "Chest Pain",
  "operator": ">=",
  "value": 50
}
```

## Observation

The `Observation` condition type tests the most recent observation of a given type against a given value. 

### Implementation Warnings

* Synthea does not support conversion between arbitrary units, so all observations of a given type are expected to be made in the same units. 
* The given observation must have been recorded prior to performing this logical check, unless the `operator` is `is nil` or `is not nil`. Otherwise, the GMF will raise an exception that the observation value cannot be compared as there has been no observation made.

### Supported Properties

| Attribute | Type | Description |
|:----------|:-----|:------------|
| `condition_type` | `string` | Must be `"Observation"`. |
| `operator` | `string` | One of [`"=="`, `"!="`, `"<"`, `">"`, `"<="`, `">="`, `"is nil"`, `"is not nil"`]. |
| `value` | `numeric` | The value to test the observation against (if numeric). |
| `value_code`| `{}` | The value to test the observation against (if code). Must be a valid LOINC code (https://github.com/synthetichealth/synthea/wiki/Generic-Module-Framework%3A-Primitive-Types#loinc-codes). |

    {
      "system": "LOINC",
      "code": "72107-6",
      "display": "Mini Mental State Examination"
    }
  ],
  "operator": ">",
  "value": 22
}
```

The following `Observation` condition will return `true` if the most recent `Observation` referenced by the attribute `"diabetes_test_performed"` on the patient has any value that is not nil. In other words, if any observation has been made and stored in attribute `diabetes_test_performed`, this condition will return `true`:

```json
{
  "condition_type": "Observation",
  "referenced_by_attribute": "diabetes_test_performed",
  "operator": "is not nil"
}
```

## Vital Sign
The `Vital Sign` condition type tests a patient's current vital signs. Synthea tracks vital signs in order to drive a patient's physical condition, and are recorded in observations. See also the [[Symptom|Generic Module Framework: States#VitalSign]] state.

### Supported Properties

The following `Vital Sign` condition will return `true` if the patient's Systolic Blood Pressure vital sign is greater than 120:

```json
{
    "condition_type" : "Vital Sign",
    "vital_sign" : "Systolic Blood Pressure",
    "operator" : ">",
    "value" : 120
  },
```

## Active Condition

The `Active Condition` condition type tests whether a given condition is currently diagnosed and active on the patient. 

### Future Implementation Considerations

Currently to check if a condition has been added but not diagnosed, it is possible to use the [`PriorState`](#priorstate) condition to check if the state has been processed. In the future it may be preferable to add a distinct "Present Condition" logical condition to clearly specify the intent of looking for a present but not diagnosed condition.

### Supported Properties

| Attribute | Type | Description |

| `condition_type` | `string` | Must be `"Active Condition"`. |
| `codes` or `referenced_by_attribute` | `[]` or `string` | **(choice)** Must be either a list of [SNOMED codes](https://github.com/synthetichealth/synthea/wiki/Generic-Module-Framework%3A-Primitive-Types#snomed-codes) or an `attribute` referencing a condition. |

### Examples

The following `Active Condition` condition will return `true` if the patient currently has an active diagnosis of `SNOMED-CT 73211009 [Diabetes mellitus]`:

```json
{
  "condition_type": "Active Condition",
  "codes": [
    {
      "system": "SNOMED-CT",
      "code": "73211009",
      "display": "Diabetes mellitus"
    }
  ]
}
```

The following `Active Condition` condition will return `true` if the condition referenced by the attribute `"alzheimers_variant"` on the patient is currently active. In other words, if any condition has onset and is stored in the attribute "Alzheimer's Variant", this condition will return `true`:

```json
{
  "condition_type": "Active Condition",
  "referenced_by_attribute": "alzheimers_variant"
}

    }
  ]
}
```

The following `Active Medication` condition will return `true` if the medication referenced by the attribute `"pain_medication"` on the patient is currently active.

  "referenced_by_attribute" : "pain_medication"
}
```

## Active CarePlan

{
  "condition_type" : "Active CarePlan",
  "referenced_by_attribute" : "diabetes_careplan"
}
```

## PriorState

The `PriorState` condition type tests the progression of the patient through the module, and checks if a specific state has already been processed (in other words, the state is in the module's state history). The search for the state may be limited by time or the name of another state.

### Supported Properties

  "name": "Emergency_Encounter"
}
```

The following `PriorState` condition will return `true` if the patient has passed through a state called `"Emergency_Encounter"` within the last 3 years, or `false` if the patient has never passed through the state, or last passed through the state more than 3 years ago:

```json
{
  "condition_type": "PriorState",
  "name": "Emergency_Encounter",
  "within": { "quantity": 3, "unit" : "years"}
}
```

The following `PriorState` condition will return `true` if the patient has already passed through a state called `"Emergency_Encounter"` since last passing through a state called "Followup", `false` otherwise. (In other words, if the patient hit state "Emergency_Encounter" more recently than state "Followup". Note that it is not necessary for the state "Followup" to have been hit for this to return true.)

```json
{
  "condition_type": "PriorState",
  "name": "Emergency_Encounter",
  "since" : "Followup"
}
```

      "unit": "years"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Or

      "unit": "years"
    }
  ]
}
```

## At Least

The `At Least` condition type tests that a minimum number of conditions from a set of sub-conditions are true.  If the _minimum_ number or more sub-conditions are true, it will return `true`, but if less than the minimum are true, it will return `false`. (If the _minimum_ is the same as the number of sub-conditions provided, this is equivalent to the `And` condition. If _minimum_ is 1, this is equivalent to the `Or` condition.)

### Supported Properties
