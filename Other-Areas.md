By default, Synthea contains demographics, zip codes, providers, names, and costs for the entire United States, post-processed from publicly available files.

You can modify these files or have Synthea use an alternative files by altering the `src/main/resources/synthea.properties` file:

```properties
# Default demographics is every city in the US
generate.demographics.default_file = geography/demographics.csv
generate.geography.zipcodes.default_file = geography/zipcodes.csv

# Default provider files (1 of 10 files)
generate.providers.hospitals.default_file = providers/hospitals.csv

# Default costs, to be used for pricing something that we don't have a specific price for
generate.costs.default_procedure_cost = 500.00
generate.costs.default_medication_cost = 255.00
generate.costs.default_encounter_cost = 125.00
generate.costs.default_immunization_cost = 136.00
```

You can find detailed instructions on each of these file formats on the Synthea Wiki:

* **Demographics** file contains city-level distributions of Gender, Race, Age, Income, and Education which all play a role in health access, outcomes, and costs. https://github.com/synthetichealth/synthea/wiki/Demographics-for-Other-Areas
* **Zip or postal code** file contains postal codes and geographic locations (latitude and longitude) for each location. https://github.com/synthetichealth/synthea/wiki/Zip-or-Postal-Codes
* **Provider** files contains information and locations (latitude and longitude) for each provider location. https://github.com/synthetichealth/synthea/wiki/Provider-Data
* **Names** file contains language-specific family names and first names by gender. It also contains names suitable for street addresses. https://github.com/synthetichealth/synthea/wiki/Name-Data
* **Cost** files contain costs for different types of Encounters, Procedures, Medications, and Immunizations. https://github.com/synthetichealth/synthea/wiki/Cost-Data

### Abridged Example for Shrewsbury, Shropshire, United Kingdom

Districting and addresses in the United Kingdom differ from the United States. Let's start with the **demographics** file:

```csv
,COUNTY,NAME,STNAME,POPESTIMATE2015,CTYNAME,TOT_POP,TOT_MALE,TOT_FEMALE,WHITE,HISPANIC,BLACK,ASIAN,NATIVE,OTHER,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,00..10,10..15,15..25,25..35,35..50,50..75,75..100,100..150,150..200,200..999,LESS_THAN_HS,HS_DEGREE,SOME_COLLEGE,BS_DEGREE
1,1,Shrewsbury,West Midlands,2620,Shropshire,486300,0.489,0.511,0.985,0,0.001,0.004,0,0,0.063,0.063,0.063,0.052,0.052,0.052,0.052,0.052,0.076,0.076,0.076,0.076,0.076,0.035,0.035,0.035,0.035,0.035,0.133333333,0.133333333,0.133333333,0.147225,0.147225,0.147225,0.147225,0.1,0.01,0.001,0.18,0.387,22.35,22.35
```

Next we need to create postal codes suitable to Shrewsbury, so we edit the **zip codes** file:

```csv
,USPS,ST,NAME,ZCTA5,LAT,LON
0,West Midlands,WMS,Shrewsbury,SY1,52.7081,-2.7549
1,West Midlands,WMS,Shrewsbury,SY2,52.7083,-2.7546
2,West Midlands,WMS,Shrewsbury,SY3,52.7089,-2.7543
```

Finally, we need to provide at least one hospital for our Salopians, so we edit the **hospitals** file:

```csv
,id,name,address,city,state,zip,county,phone,type,ownership,emergency,quality,LAT,LON
0,010001,Royal Shrewsbury Hospital,Mytton Oak Rd,Shrewsbury,WMS,SY3 8XQ,Shropshire,01743261000,NHS Teaching Hospital,Government - Hospital District or Authority,Yes,5,52.7091,-2.7931
```

For now, let's leave the **names** and **cost** files as-is.

```
./run_synthea -s 0 -p 1 "West Midlands" Shrewsbury

It looks like we have generated a person in Shrewsbury... US? Looks like we need a little more work to do. :)
