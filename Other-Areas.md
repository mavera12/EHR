By default, Synthea contains demographics, zip codes, providers, names, and costs for the entire United States, post-processed from publicly available files.

You can modify these files or have Synthea use an alternative files by altering the `src/main/resources/synthea.properties` file:

```properties
# Default demographics is every city in the US
generate.demographics.default_file = geography/demographics.csv
generate.geography.zipcodes.default_file = geography/zipcodes.csv

# Default provider files (1 of 10 files)
generate.providers.hospitals.default_file = providers/hospitals.csv

# Default costs, to be used for pricing something that we don't have a specific price for
generate.costs.default_procedure_cost = 500.00
generate.costs.default_medication_cost = 255.00
generate.costs.default_encounter_cost = 125.00
generate.costs.default_immunization_cost = 136.00
```
