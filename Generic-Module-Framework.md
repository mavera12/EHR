Synthea contains a framework for defining modules using JSON.  These JSON modules describe a progression of states and the transitions between them.  On each Synthea generation time-step, the generic framework processes states one at a time to trigger conditions, encounters, medications, and other clinical events.

This simplified example of childhood ear infections shows the flow of a generic module. In this instance, children get ear infections at different rates based on their age, are then diagnosed at an encounter, and then are prescribed either an antibiotic or a painkiller. 

The [Module Builder](https://synthetichealth.github.io/module-builder/) is a web interface for clinicians and other healthcare professionals to design Synthea modules with no programming experience required.

Details and examples for the core generic module concepts are available on the following pages:

## Relevant Files and Paths

Within the _synthea_ repository, the following files and paths are relevant to the generic module framework:

* **`src/main/resources/modules/`**: the path containing the JSON module files that Synthea should process
* **`src/main/java/org/mitre/synthea/engine/Module.java`**: the `Module` class definition; responsible for maintaining a module's state definition.  The `Module` class also processes states and transitions.
* **`src/main/java/org/mitre/synthea/engine/Logic.java`**: the `Logic` class implements the methods corresponding to the supported logical condition types
* **`src/main/java/org/mitre/synthea/engine/State.java`**: the `State` class implements the supported state types
* **`src/test/resources/generic/*.json`**: the test fixtures for all of the generic module framework unit tests
* **`src/test/java/org/mitre/synthea/engine/*Test.java`**: the unit tests for the generic module framework's context, logic, and state implementations
