By default, the project contains Payers (i.e. public and private health insurance companies) in the `src/main/resources/payers/insurance_companies.csv` file, which is a list of some public and private insurers who provide services nationally (US). 

**The default financial numbers (e.g. premiums and copays) are not accurate.**

You can modify the payer file or have Synthea use an alternative payer file by altering the `src/main/resources/synthea.properties` file:

```properties
# Payers
generate.payers.insurance_companies.default_file = payers/insurance_companies.csv

# Payer selection behavior
# How patients select a payer:
#  best_rates - select insurance with best rates for person's existing conditions and medical needs
#  random  - select randomly.
generate.payers.selection_behavior = random
```

## Payer File Format

The payer file is a CSV file, with a single row for each payer.
