##Welcome to the Synthea wiki!

Synthea is a synthetic patient generator that models the medical history of synthetic patients. Some attributes that are currently modeled include cardiovascular diseases, diabetes and associated symptoms, food allergies, immunizations, and much more. The objective is to create a collection of fake, but realistic, electronic health records outputted in a variety of formats. Currently supported formats are C-CDA and FHIR STU3.
