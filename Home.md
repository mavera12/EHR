#Welcome to the Synthea Wiki!

For a quick start guide, see the [README](https://github.com/synthetichealth/synthea/blob/master/README.md).

##Mission Statement

Synthea is a synthetic patient generator that models the medical history of synthetic patients. Our mission is to output high-quality synthetic, realistic but not real, patient data and associated health records covering every aspect of healthcare. The resulting data is free from cost, privacy, and security restrictions. It can be used without restriction for a variety of secondary uses in academia, research, industry, and government (although a citation would be appreciated).

## We are actively looking for project contributors and maintainers!
