##Welcome to the Synthea wiki!

Synthea is a synthetic patient generator that models the medical history of synthetic patients. Some attributes that are currently modeled include cardiovascular diseases, diabetes and associated symptoms, food allergies, immunizations, and much more. Their electronic health records are outputted in C-CDA and FHIR STU3 formats.

Modules can be added to the project to add new diseases and conditions that patients can acquire.
