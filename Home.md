#Welcome to the Synthea Wiki!

##Mission Statement

Synthea is a synthetic patient generator that models the medical history of synthetic patients. Our mission is to output high-quality synthetic, realistic but not real, patient data and associated health records covering every aspect of healthcare. The resulting data is free from cost, privacy, and security restrictions. It can be used without restriction for a variety of secondary uses in academia, research, industry, and government (although a citation would be appreciated).

For a quick start guide, see the [README](https://github.com/synthetichealth/synthea/blob/master/README.md).

## We are actively looking for project contributors and maintainers! 

If you are new to open source, please check out [github's guide to contributing](https://guides.github.com/activities/contributing-to-open-source/), otherwise please start contributing by:
- [Creating Issues](https://github.com/synthetichealth/synthea/issues/new)
- Forking our repos and issuing pull requests

In particular we are targeting the [Global Burden of Disease (GBD) Top 10 Leading Causes of Years of Life Lost (YLL) for the United States](http://www.healthdata.org/united-states) (listed below), but are interested in any diseases. We prefer that new contributions come in the form of [generic modules](https://github.com/synthetichealth/synthea/wiki/Generic-Module-Framework).
