By default, the project contains demographics for the entire United States in `src/main/resources/geography/demographics.csv` which has been post-processed from publicly available US Census Bureau files.

You can modify the demographics file or have Synthea use an alternative demographics file by altering the `src/main/resources/synthea.properties` file:

```properties
# default demographics is every city in the US
generate.demographics.default_file = geography/demographics.csv
```

If you modify or replace the demographics file, you may also need to replace the [Zip or Postal Codes](https://github.com/synthetichealth/synthea/wiki/Zip-or-Postal-Codes) file which contains postal codes and geographic locations (latitude and longitude) for each location, and the [Providers](https://github.com/synthetichealth/synthea/wiki/Provider-Data) file which contains information and locations (latitude and longitude) for each provider location.

You may also want to change patient names to be more appropriate for another area (e.g. not so North American). If so, you'll also need to modify or replace the [Names](https://github.com/synthetichealth/synthea/wiki/Name-Data) file.

### Generating a State or City
For example, you can generate synthetic patients for the state of New York:
```
run_synthea "New York"
```

Alternatively, you can generate a single city:
```
run_synthea Utah "Salt Lake City"
```

### Scaling the Population
You can generate the population at scale by using the `-p` command line switch to only generate a specific number of patients. For example, generating a hundred patients:

```
run_synthea -p 100 Utah "Salt Lake City"
```

## Demographics File Format

The demographics file is a CSV file, with a single row for each city.

* Education: `LESS_THAN_HS`,`HS_DEGREE`,`SOME_COLLEGE`,`BS_DEGREE`

Gender, Race, Age, Income, and Education all play a role in health access, outcomes, and costs.

Synthea uses Gender, Race, and Age in some disease modules because these are factors in disease prevalence and incidence rates.
Synthea uses Income and Education to determine a socioeconomic status. The socioeconomic calculation is here: https://github.com/synthetichealth/synthea/blob/a0e959742cd2ae6ae188fc24af79a660ccf9ea08/src/main/java/org/mitre/synthea/world/geography/Demographics.java#L343

## Examples for Other Areas

These are incomplete partial examples for illustration purposes.

If running Synthea for non-US locations, patient records may still require post-processing to clean up the listed country (`US` will still appear in an address) and  [Zip or Postal Codes](https://github.com/synthetichealth/synthea/wiki/Zip-or-Postal-Codes)  within addresses.

### Abridged Example for United Kingdom
Districting and addresses in the United Kingdom differ from the United States. In this example, the County is entered in the `CTYNAME` column and the Region is entered in the `STNAME`.
