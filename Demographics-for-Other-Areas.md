By default, the project contains demographics for the entire United States in `src/main/resources/geography/demographics.csv` which has been post-processed from publicly available US Census Bureau files.

If you modify or replace the demographics file, you may also need to replace `src/main/resources/geography/zipcodes.csv` which contains postal codes and geographic locations (latitude and longitude) for each location.

If you want to change patient names to be more appropriate for another area (e.g. not so North American) you'll also need to modify or replace the `src/main/resources/names.yml` file.

### Generating a State or City
For example, you can generate synthetic patients for the state of New York:
```
run_synthea "New York"
```

Alternatively, you can generate a single city:
```
run_synthea Utah "Salt Lake City"
```

### Scaling the Population
If you crack open the `config/synthea.yml` file you can generate the entire population of each city, or a percentage of the population.  Set `synthea.sequential.population_scaling` to `true` to generate scaled portion of the population, or `false` to generate everyone in the city. You can set the scale factor in `synthea.sequential.population_scaling_rate`.


### Demographics File Format

The demographics file is a CSV file, with a single row for each city.

The following columns in each row should sum to `1.0`
* Gender: `TOT_MALE`,`TOT_FEMALE`
* Race: `WHITE`,`HISPANIC`,`BLACK`,`ASIAN`,`NATIVE`,`OTHER`
* Age: `1`,`2`,`3`,`4`,`5`,`6`,`7`,`8`,`9`,`10`,`11`,`12`,`13`,`14`,`15`,`16`,`17`,`18`
* Income: `00..10`,`10..15`,`15..25`,`25..35`,`35..50`,`50..75`,`75..100`,`100..150`,`150..200`,`200..999`
* Education: `LESS_THAN_HS`,`HS_DEGREE`,`SOME_COLLEGE`,`BS_DEGREE`

Gender, Race, Age, Income, and Education all play a role in health access, outcomes, and costs.

Synthea uses Gender, Race, and Age in some disease modules because these are factors in disease prevalence and incidence rates.
Synthea uses Income and Education to determine a socioeconomic status. The socioeconomic calculation is here: https://github.com/synthetichealth/synthea/blob/00bd0928d353e6d713d9d4f6d1a3163a1d5103b6/lib/modules/lifecycle.rb#L460

## Examples for Other Areas

These are incomplete partial examples for illustration purposes.

If running Synthea for non-US locations, patient records may still require post-processing to clean up the listed country (`US` will still appear) and postal codes within addresses.

### Abridged Example for United Kingdom
Districting and addresses in the United Kingdom differ from the United States. In this example, the County is entered in the `STNAME` column and the District is entered in the `CTYNAME`.
